### Introduction

PERN (postgres, express, react, node) is a framework that allows developers interested in these technologies to get up and running with a minimum of fuss. It's still a work in progress, but it has the following pieces:

* node/express backend for API calls
* postgres database with minimal schema to demonstrate functionality
* React/Redux frontend to demonstrate simple functionality
* configuration files (e.g., nginx)
* Instructions on how to set everything up

###### TODO

* Unit tests
* Minimal React Native app
