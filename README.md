### Introduction

PERN (postgres, express, react, node) is a framework that allows developers interested in these technologies to get up and running with a minimum of fuss. It's still a work in progress, but the goal will be to have the following pieces:

 * node/express backend for API calls
 * postgres database with minimal schema to demonstrate functionality
 * React/Redux frontend to demonstrate simple functionality
 * configuration files (e.g., nginx)
 * Instructions on how to set everything up

Eventually, it would be nice to have a minimal React Native app to demonstrate communication with the backend.
